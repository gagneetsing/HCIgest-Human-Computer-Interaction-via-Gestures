Overview
The Sign Language Detection project is designed to recognize sign language gestures in real time, enabling effective interaction with machines. By tracking body, hand, and face landmarks through MediaPipe, it can accurately identify predefined gestures, enhancing accessibility and communication.

Installation
To set up the project environment, install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy tensorflow matplotlib
Usage
1. Data Collection
The system collects keypoints from video input for the following predefined gestures:

üëã Hello
üôè Thanks
‚ù§Ô∏è I Love You
‚úîÔ∏è Yes
‚ùå No
üÜò Help
üôá Please
2. Running the Script
Capture video input and collect gesture data by running the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python sign_language_detection.py
3. Model Training
Once sufficient data is collected, train the model using the captured keypoints:

python
Copy
Edit
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=35, callbacks=[tb_callback])
4. Real-Time Prediction
After training, the model can predict gestures in real time using a webcam feed.

Model Architecture
The model is designed with a robust sequence processing architecture:

Bidirectional LSTM Layers: To learn the temporal dynamics of gestures.
Dropout Layers: To mitigate overfitting during training.
Dense Layers: For final gesture classification.
Training Process
Load and preprocess the collected gesture data.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Compile the model using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
Train the model and evaluate its performance.
Key Features
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Detects gestures seamlessly from live video input.
Holistic Tracking: Uses MediaPipe's holistic model for accurate landmark detection.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides direct feedback on the video feed during recognition.
